# Incident Hub – Figma Import Guide

This folder contains an SVG wireframe for three desktop screens: Dashboard, Profile, and About.

How to use in Figma

1. Open Figma and create a new Design file.
2. Drag and drop `IncidentHub_Wireframes.svg` into the canvas, or use File → Place Image… and select the SVG.
3. After import, select a screen group (Dashboard / Profile / About) and use Ungroup as needed to edit layers.
4. Apply your design system: swap fonts, colors, and components as desired. The structure aligns with the app’s CSS (cards, badges, navbar, sidebar).

Notes

- The SVG is vector-based and fully editable in Figma.
- You can convert recurring elements (cards, badges) into Figma Components.
- If you prefer separate files per screen, duplicate the main file and delete the screens you don’t need.
